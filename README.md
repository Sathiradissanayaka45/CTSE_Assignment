# üåü Microservices-Based Application: Authentication and Product Catalog Services üåü

Welcome to the repository for our e-commerce platform's microservices! This project features two essential services: **Authentication Service** and **Product Catalog Service**. Both services are containerized, deployed on AWS ECS using Fargate, and secured with modern DevOps and DevSecOps practices.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **secure**, **scalable**, and **containerized** microservices-based application. The two microservices are:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user registration, login, email verification, password reset, and token-based authentication using JWT.
- **Product Catalog Service**: Manages product and category data for an e-commerce platform, including CRUD operations for products and categories.

Both services are deployed on AWS ECS using Fargate and are accessible via an Application Load Balancer.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture
The application follows a microservices architecture deployed on AWS. Below is the architecture diagram:

![Architecture Overview](./assets/architecture-diagram.png)

### **Components**:
- **Frontend**: A web-based interface for users to interact with the services.
- **AWS Application Load Balancer**: Routes traffic to the appropriate microservice based on the URL path.
- **ECS Cluster**: Hosts the containerized microservices using AWS Fargate.
- **MongoDB Atlas**: A managed NoSQL database for storing user and product data.

## ‚ú® Features

### **Authentication Service**
- ‚úÖ User registration with email verification.
- üîí Secure login with JWT-based authentication.
- üîÑ Password reset functionality.
- üîë Token refresh mechanism.
- üë§ Role-based access control (RBAC) for admin and customer roles.

### **Product Catalog Service**
- üì¶ CRUD operations for products and categories.
- üìä Pagination, filtering, and sorting for product listings.
- üîê Role-based access control for admin-only endpoints.

## üì° Endpoints

### **Authentication Service**

| Endpoint | Method | Access Role | Description | Security Features |
|----------|--------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| `/api/auth/register` | POST | Public | Register a new user. | Password hashing, input validation |
| `/api/auth/login` | POST | Public | Login and receive access/refresh tokens. | JWT-based authentication |
| `/api/auth/verify-email` | POST | Public | Verify user email using a token. | Token-based email verification |
| `/api/auth/refresh-token` | POST | Public | Refresh access token using a refresh token. | Secure refresh token validation |
| `/api/auth/logout` | POST | Public | Logout and invalidate refresh token. | Token invalidation |
| `/api/auth/forgot-password` | POST | Public | Send password reset email. | Email-based token validation |
| `/api/auth/reset-password` | POST | Public | Reset password using a token. | Token-based password reset |

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas
- **Authentication**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Cloud Deployment**: AWS ECS (Fargate), Application Load Balancer
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **DevSecOps**: SonarCloud for static code analysis

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Running Instructions

### **Prerequisites**
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- Docker
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- MongoDB Atlas account

### **Steps to Run Locally**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/microservices-app.git
   cd microservices-app

2. **Set up environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file in both `auth-service` and `catalog-service` directories.
    - Add required variables by referencing the `.env.example` files [[1]] [[2]] [[3]] [[5]] [[8]].

3. **Start services**:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```
    - Access services locally:
        - Authentication Service: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth`
        - Product Catalog Service: `http://localhost:3001/api/products`

## üöÄ Deployment (AWS ECS)
**Infrastructure**: Deployed on AWS ECS using Fargate with GitHub Actions automation.

**Deployment Steps**:
1. Push changes to `main` branch
2. GitHub Actions pipeline:
    - Build Docker images
    - Push images to Amazon ECR
    - Update ECS services with new images [[3]] [[8]]
  
**Deployed Endpoints**:
- Authentication Service: `http://<ALB-DNS>/api/auth`
- Product Catalog Service: `http://<ALB-DNS>/api/products`

## üîí Security Measures
- **JWT Authentication**: Short-lived tokens + refresh tokens
- **Password Hashing**: `bcrypt` for stored passwords
- **Rate Limiting**: Enabled for login/registration endpoints [[2]] [[3]] [[8]]
- **Secret Management**: Sensitive variables stored in `.env`/AWS Secrets Manager [[10]]
- **RBAC**: Admin-only endpoint protection
- **Code Analysis**: SonarCloud integrated for vulnerability detection
